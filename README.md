# Destination-sol
This project is based off of the game made by Milosh Petrov and his team, under the same name.

We're looking to make our own spin on the game using the available assets and code that Milosh and his team created, fixing issues that made the game cumbersome and adding new systems to expand the experience.

The original game is in Java, which we feel is showing signs of age and growing obsolete. We are moving the game over to the Love2D engine ( http://www.love2d.org ) using Lua, which is a much more accessible language, making modding easier.

We may change the name of our project if it becomes very unlike the original Destination Sol.

If we decide to monetize our game, we promise:
* There will be no microtransactions or pay-to-win content
* It will cost less than $10
* We will only release a high-quality game that WE love to play

Plans include:
* More ships, weapons, items, etc.
* Rewards
* Faction interaction
* Ship customization
